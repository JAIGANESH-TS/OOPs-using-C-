Exception Handling
Ravi wants to do some arithmetic operations for his grocery store. He was planning to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a fast way so that he can reduce the time for calculation. Ravi wants to get two inputs as integer and to do the operation.

If anyone of the input is zero it should print as "Bad Operation", if he enters any numbers or character instead of operators it should display that "It is not a Valid Operator" and if the entered values are the correct form it has to display the answer.
