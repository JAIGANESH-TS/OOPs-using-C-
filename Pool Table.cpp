/*Arun has a pool table(8 ball-pool table) and it is rectangular in shape. The pocket of the pool table is a circle shape. Arun wants to calculate the perimeter of the pool table and the perimeter of its pocket. Help him to find out.
Note: Use pure virtual function.

Create a class with the name Shape.

Create two methods named Enter_data() and Perimeter() as pure virtual function.

Create a class with the name Rectangle and inherited from a class Shape.

The class needs two fields with the name length and breadth of type float.

Method named Enter_data() without any parameter, it needs to get the value of length and breadth.

Method named Perimeter() without any parameter, it needs to calculate the perimeter of rectangle.

Create a class with the name Circle and inherited from a class Shape.

The class needs one field with the name radius of type float.

Method named Enter_data() without any parameter, it needs to get the value of radius field.

Method named Perimeter() without any parameter, it needs to calculate the perimeter of circle.

Input Format :

Input consist of 3 integers.

First input represents the length of pool table

Second input represents breadth of pool table

Third input represents radius of the table pocket.

Output Format :

Output consist of 1 integer 1 float.

First output represents the perimeter of pool table.

Second output represents perimeter of pool tableâ€™s pocket .

Sample Input:

74

30

17

Sample Output:

Perimeter of rectangle: 208

Perimeter of circle: 106.76

Case 1
Case 2
Input (stdin)
3
